 # TANK-WATER
**Tank Water** is a scholarly work with punctuation.

# Statement
Create a Java program using Topics to simulate a water tank associated with two water faucets: one used to fill the tank and another used to empty the tank.

# Rules
**a)** The total capacity of the tank is 2000 liters and each "ball" represents 10 liters.

**b)** The faucet that fills the tank has a flow of 10 liters every 150 ms (milliseconds).

**c)** The faucet that empties the tank has a flow of 30 liters every 150 ms
(milliseconds).

**d)** The tank controller is responsible for opening and closing the taps.

**e)** When the tank reaches its maximum volume, the filling tap is closed and the drain tap is opened.

**f)** When the tank is below 50% of its volume the be open.

**g)** When the volume of water is below the emptying tap, this tap
should be closed.

# Technical details of the solution
**a)** At least 3 classes must be implemented: one to represent the taps,
another to represent the tank and the third to represent the tank controller. filling and emptying the tank.

**b)** The faucet that fills the tank is a thread, the faucet that empties the tank is another thread and the tank controller is the third thread.

**c)** The Console class is being sent with this document. This class was
implemented the clearScreen () method, which clears the console screen. Important: This Console version has been tested only on Windows and will probably not work. on Linux.
